as you can see any line that doesnt start with `https://`
gets completely ignored! this makes it possible to allow
for reading from an markdown file at some point!

curseforge works!
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium


so does modrinth!
https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api


it doesnt do anything else at the moment as
I havent implemented making custom mod.pw.toml
files yet!
